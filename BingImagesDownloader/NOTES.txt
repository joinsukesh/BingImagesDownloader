The Bing images information is available from Bing using this URL: http://www.bing.com/HPImageArchive.aspx?format=xml&idx=0&n=1&mkt=en-US.

As the format parameter indicates, this will return an XML formatted stream that contains information such as the date the images is for, 
the relative URL, description, and copyright information.

The idx parameter tells where you want to start from. 
0 would start at the current day, 1 the previous day, 2 the day after that, etc. 
For instance, if the date were 1/30/2011, using idx = 0, the file would start with 20110130; using idx = 1, it would start with 20110129; and so forth.

The n parameter tells how many images to return. n = 1 would return only one, n = 2 would return two, and so on.

The mkt parameter tells which of the eight markets Bing is available for you would like images from. 
The valid values are: en-US, zh-CN, ja-JP, en-AU, en-UK, de-DE, en-NZ, en-CA.
